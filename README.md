## Short description of my implementation:
The website I created is a simple website for the fll referees to use during the competition.
Each referee need to enter his name and the team number he is judging.
Then he can choose the status of each mission (for example: done / not done).
After the referee is done with the judging, he can press the "submit" button and the website will send the data to the backend scoring api.
after the api is done with calculating the score, the website will show the score of the team the referee just judged.

## Time spent:
From the moment I started until I finished, it took a week and a half. But this week and a half included several days of studying for the final math exam and some other things I had to do. In addition, I had previous experience in UI design by using the ant design library. Still, I decided that I would do this project with material ui as you recommended, so most of the time was also spent studying the library.
